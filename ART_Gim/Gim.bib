	abstract = {Explanations in the life sciences frequently involve presenting a model of the mechanism taken to be responsible for a given phenomenon. Such explanations depart in numerous ways from nomological explanations commonly presented in philosophy of science. This paper focuses on three sorts of diﬀerences. First, scientists who develop mechanistic explanations are not limited to linguistic representations and logical inference; they frequently employ diagrams to characterize mechanisms and simulations to reason about them. Thus, the epistemic resources for presenting mechanistic explanations are considerably richer than those suggested by a nomological framework. Second, the fact that mechanisms involve organized systems of component parts and operations provides direction to both the discovery and testing of mechanistic explanations. Finally, models of mechanisms are developed for speciﬁc exemplars and are not represented in terms of universally quantiﬁed statements. Generalization involves investigating both the similarity of new exemplars to those already studied and the variations between them.},

Ecologists study nutrient cycling mechanisms and their devastating imbalances in estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay. In fact, much of biology and its history involves biologists constructing, evaluating, and revising their understanding of mechanisms.           With In Search of Mechanisms, Carl F. Craver and Lindley Darden offer both a descriptive and an instructional account of how biologists discover mechanisms. Drawing on examples from across the life sciences and through the centuries, Craver and Darden compile an impressive toolbox of strategies that biologists have used and will use again to reveal the mechanisms that produce, underlie, or maintain the phenomena characteristic of living things. They discuss the questions that figure in the search for mechanisms, characterizing the experimental, observational, and conceptual considerations used to answer them, all the while providing examples from the history of biology to highlight the kinds of evidence and reasoning strategies employed to assess mechanisms. At a deeper level, Craver and Darden pose a systematic view of what biology is, of how biology makes progress, of how biological discoveries are and might be made, and of why knowledge of biological mechanisms is important for the future of the human species.},

In this article, I argue, ﬁrst, that a method (the renormalization group) they propose to answer the three questions cannot answer them, at least not by itself. Second, I argue that answers to the three questions are unnecessary to account for the explanatoriness of their minimal models. Finally, I argue that a common features account, what I call the ‘generalized ontic conception of explanation’, can capture the explanatoriness of minimal models.},

            Science represents natural phenomena by means of theories, as well as in many concrete ways by such means as pictures, graphs, table-top models, and computer simulations. This book begins with an inquiry into the nature of representation in general, drawing on such diverse sources as Plato's dialogues, the development of perspectival drawing in the Renaissance, and the geometric styles of modeling in modern physics. Starting with Mach's and Poincaré's analyses of measurement and Reichenbach's ‘problem of coordination’, this book presents a view of measurement outcomes as representations achieved in a process of mutual stabilization of theory and empirical inquiry. With respect to the theories of contemporary science, the book defends an empiricist structuralist version of the ‘picture theory’ of science, compatible with a constructive empiricist view, through an inquiry into the paradoxes that came to light in 20th-century philosophies of science. It is argued that indexicality enters irreducibly into the conditions of use and application of measurement, models, and theories. The book concludes with an analysis of the complex relationship between appearance and reality in the scientific world-picture, arguing against the completeness criterion that demands a derivation of the appearances from the theoretically postulated reality.},

	abstract = {Many people assume that the claims of scientists are objective truths. But historians, sociologists, and philosophers of science have long argued that scientific claims reflect the particular historical, cultural, and social context in which those claims were made. The nature of scientific knowledge is not absolute because it is influenced by the practice and perspective of human agents. Scientific Perspectivism argues that the acts of observing and theorizing are both perspectival, and this nature makes scientific knowledge contingent, as Thomas Kuhn theorized forty years ago.Using the example of color vision in humans to illustrate how his theory of “perspectivism” works, Ronald N. Giere argues that colors do not actually exist in objects; rather, color is the result of an interaction between aspects of the world and the human visual system. Giere extends this argument into a general interpretation of human perception and, more controversially, to scientific observation, conjecturing that the output of scientific instruments is perspectival. Furthermore, complex scientific principles—such as Maxwell’s equations describing the behavior of both the electric and magnetic fields—make no claims about the world, but models based on those principles can be used to make claims about specific aspects of the world. Offering a solution to the most contentious debate in the philosophy of science over the past thirty years, Scientific Perspectivism will be of interest to anyone involved in the study of science.},

(1986) Science 231, 470-475]. Based on the known properties of this enzyme, a detailed model is developed for the template-dependent synthesis of RNA by an RNA polymerase itself made of RNA. The monomer units for RNA synthesis are tetra- and pentanucleotides of random base sequence. Polymerization occurs in a 5'-to-3' direction, and elongation rates are expected to approach two residues per minute. If the RNA enzyme could use another copy of itself as a template, RNA self-replication could be achieved. Thus, it seems possible that RNA catalysts might have played a part in prebiotic nucleic acid replication, prior to the availability of useful proteins.},

Some of these (z mutations) are expressed by loss of the capacity to synthesize active enzyme. Others (i mutations) allow the enzyme to be synthesized constitutively instead of inducibly as in the wild type. The study of galactosidase synthesis in heteromerozygotes of E. coli indicates that the z and i mutations belong to different cistrons. Moreover the constitutive allele of the i cistron is recessive over the inducible allele. The kinetics of expression of the i+ (inducible) character suggest that the i gene controls the synthesis of a specific substance which represses the synthesis of (β-galactosidase. The constitutive state results from loss of the capacity to synthesize active repressor.},

Trimers with (2′-5′) phosphodiester linkages, (2′-5′)-UpUpU and also (2′-5′)-ApApA, did not serve as templates for phenylalanine- or lysine-sRNA, respectively. The relative template efficiency of oligo A preparations was as follows: p-5′-ApApA {\textgreater} ApApA {\textgreater} ApApA-3′-p {\textgreater} ApApA-2′-p. The hexamer, ApApApApApA was considerably more active as a template than the corresponding pentamer. These data indicate that two adjacent triplets are recognized by two AA-sRNA molecules bound to nearby ribosomal sites. A doublet with 5′-terminal phosphate, pUpC, served as a template for serine-sRNA, whereas a doublet without terminal phosphate, UpC, did not. Although the template efficiency of pUpC was lower than that of the triplet UpCpU the data show that serine-sRNA can recognize pUpC.},

Cyclization involves cleavage of the linear IVS RNA 15 nucleotides from its 5′ end and formation of a phosphodiester bond between the new 5′ phosphate and the original 3′-hydroxyl terminus of the IVS. This recombination mechanism is analogous to that by which splicing of the precursor RNA is achieved. The circular molecules appear to have no direct function in RNA splicing, and we propose the cyclization serves to prevent unwanted RNA from driving the splicing reactions backwards.},

In doing so, he enters a long-standing discussion about the relationship between the mechanistic structures evident in the theories of contemporary biology and the laws of nature privileged especially in traditional empiricist traditions of the philosophy of science (see, e.g., Wimsatt 1974; Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Bogen, Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci, 36:397–420, 2005; Darden 2006; Glennan, Erkenntnis, 44:49–71, 1996; MDC, Philos Sci, 67:1–25, 2000; Schaffner 1993; Tabery 2004; Weber 2005). In our view, Leuridan misconstrues this discussion. His weak positive claim that mechanistic sciences appeal to generalizations is true but uninteresting. His stronger claim that all causal claims require laws is unsupported by his arguments. Though we proceed by criticizing Leuridan’s arguments, our greater purpose is to embellish his arguments in order to show how thinking about mechanisms enriches and transforms old philosophical debates about laws in biology and provides new insights into how generalizations afford prediction, explanation, and control.},
